        <h2>NJ ENTRY POINTS: MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY</h2>
        
        <div class="essay-content">
            <p>The Hudson River presents a natural barrier between New York City and New Jersey, creating a clearly defined western cellular membrane for Manhattan. This boundary is punctuated by five major "receptor sites" that regulate the flow of people, goods, and resources between these areas: the George Washington Bridge, the Lincoln Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel, the North River Tunnels, and the PATH Downtown Hudson Tubes.</p>
            
            <p>In Urban Cell Theory, these entry points function as selectively permeable channels through which the city's metabolic processes occur. Each entry point has unique characteristics that influence its permeability, capacity, and flow dynamics:</p>
            
            <h3>GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE</h3>
            <p>Connecting Fort Lee, NJ to Upper Manhattan, this bridge serves as the northernmost receptor site. Its high capacity facilitates massive vehicular flow, particularly for goods distribution and commuter traffic. The bridge's elevated position creates a distinctive type of membrane opening that minimally disrupts the urban fabric on either side.</p>
            
            <h3>LINCOLN TUNNEL</h3>
            <p>This three-tube tunnel links Weehawken, NJ to Midtown Manhattan. As a subsurface connection, it represents a more discrete type of cellular receptor that moves flows beneath the visible membrane. The Lincoln Tunnel's strategic midtown location makes it critical for commuter access to Manhattan's commercial core.</p>
            
            <h3>HOLLAND TUNNEL</h3>
            <p>Connecting Jersey City to Lower Manhattan, this twin-tube tunnel established in 1927 was the first vehicular tunnel beneath the Hudson. Its limited capacity creates a controlled flow rate that demonstrates how cellular membranes can regulate metabolic exchanges through structural constraints.</p>
            
            <h3>NORTH RIVER TUNNELS</h3>
            <p>These twin rail tunnels carry Amtrak and NJ Transit trains under the Hudson, connecting to Penn Station. As mass transit conduits, they represent the highest-efficiency receptor sites in terms of human movement, channeling the largest volume of people with the smallest membrane perforation.</p>
            
            <h3>PATH TUBES</h3>
            <p>The rapid transit system connecting Newark, Jersey City, and Hoboken to Lower Manhattan represents a specialized receptor type optimized for high-frequency, moderate-volume flows. These tunnels enable a continuous circulation pattern that maintains cellular homeostasis during daily cycles.</p>
            
            <p>Together, these five entry points demonstrate how urban cell membranes are not uniform barriers but complex interfaces with specialized receptor sites. The controlled permeability they provide allows New York City to maintain its distinct cellular identity while facilitating necessary metabolic exchanges with adjacent urban areas.</p>
